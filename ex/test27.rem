A first attempt at object like behaviour.
Now changed to deal with real objects.
==== begin person object ====

create person (the-name) (years) years old :
	create
		name : the-name
		age : years

		name and age of () : 
			showline {name, " - ", age}

		increment age of () :
			age : age + 1

		bump age of () by (bump) :
			age : age + bump

		show () values:
			{ "name: ", name } ↲
			{ "age: ", age } ↲
			name and age of ()

==== end person object ====

↲
