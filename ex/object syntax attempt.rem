A first attempt at object like behaviour.

==== begin person object ====

person : {
	name : "Robert",
	age : 61,
	name-age : [ (name) info (age) ],
	incr-age :
		age : age + 1;,
	.bump age by (bump) : ; can this be interpreted in another way?
	.	age : age + bump
}

show line (person [name])

person [bump age by (4)] ; can this be interpreted in another way?

- yes, as a function call with a block parameter

Can we distinguish this with an heuristic?.
