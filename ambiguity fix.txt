The function call created when a "list-element" is accessed

The fnc-template passed to assist-create-function-call
[ [] variable-object [] expression ]

create-function-call passed the parameters
	name: ["[]" "[]"]
	actual-parameters: [variable-object expression]

This creates a function-call-stmt object with
	fnc-name: ["[]" "[]"]
	actual-parameters: [variable-object expression]

This statement will call the get-item-fnc built-in function.
If this then has an error when accessing list/list-contents it is possible it is
a function of signature "name [block]".
So we can create a call to the correct function on the fly.

create-function-call
	name: [variable-object/name "[]"]
	actual-parameters: [expression]

Then evaluate this instead.
